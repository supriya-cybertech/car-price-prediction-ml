**🚗 Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning**

Predicting used car prices using machine learning to empower buyers, sellers, and dealerships with data-driven insights.

---
🔹**Project Overview**

This project analyzes used car data and builds a predictive model to estimate car prices.

**Key Features:**

- Brand / Make

- Model

- Year of Manufacturing

- Mileage (km/l)

- Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG/Electric)

- Transmission Type (Manual/Automatic)

- Location / City

**Goal:** Build a reliable ML model to estimate car prices and understand the impact of each feature.

📊 Approach & Workflow

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and encode categorical features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize correlations and feature importance

Model Selection: Tested Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Training & Evaluation: Used train-test split, cross-validation, and metrics like MAE, MSE, and R²

Feature Importance: Identified top predictors such as car age, mileage, and brand

💻 Model Training & Evaluation
| Metric            | Initial Split | Optimized Split (Best Random State) |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| R² Score          | 0.184         | 0.860                               |
| Random State Used | 42            | 247                                 |

**🏗️ System Architecture**

The architecture of the Car Price Prediction System follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

- Data Source → Collects used car listings with attributes like brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and price.
- Preprocessing Layer → Cleans the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, encoding categorical features, and scaling     numerical values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Identifies correlations and visualizes feature importance to understand key predictors.
- Modeling Layer → Trains multiple algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to compare performance.
- Evaluation Layer → Uses metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R² with cross-validation to ensure model reliability.
- Output Layer → Generates the final predicted car price, helping buyers and sellers make data-driven decisions.
